# Natural Language Processing
My final project on machine learning approach to student retention, using natural language techniques and independent variables to target variable classifcation. 
Many universities lose a lot of money when students drop out before completing their studies
and this usually have a negative impact on the finances of the affected universities as some of
them partly or fully rely on the students tuition fees for funding. The university of Hull is not
excluded from this dilemma since the university partly relies on students tuition fees for funding,
this is why they have made student retention a priority. In this project some machine learning
classification techniques were employed to help predict the possibility of students leaving the
university of Hull before completing their studies. An anonymised personal statement of some of
the past students of the university linked with their entry profiles was used to carry out this work.
Some of the techniques used for this work are NLP techniques such as BERT, Tfidf, GloVe, NLTK
tools and Doc2vec for extracting useful features from personal statements for the text
classification work. LSTM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB are amongst the
algorithms used for the modelling of the independent variables against their target variable ‘Exit’.
Random Forest was further modelled with SMOTE to produce an accuracy of 87%.
