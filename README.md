# Natural Language Processing

Many universities lose a lot of money when students drop out before completing their studies
and this usually have a negative impact on the finances of the affected universities as some of
them partly or fully rely on the students tuition fees for funding. An anonymised personal statement of some of
the past students of the university linked with their entry profiles was used to carry out this work.
Some of the techniques used for this work are NLP techniques such as BERT, Tfidf, GloVe, NLTK
tools and Doc2vec for extracting useful features from personal statements for the text
classification work. LSTM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Multinomial NB are amongst the
algorithms used for the modelling of the independent variables against their target variable ‘Exit’.
Random Forest was further modelled with SMOTE to produce an accuracy of 87%.
