I think it is important because marine biologists study the environment and ocean and how to make sustainable ways so that human beings can utilize resources from the ocean to improve the wellbeing of humans because the ocean provides one sixth of animal protein humans eat and living oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reducing the effects on climate change. With overfishing and the damage to the habitats I believe it is incredibly important to protect and conserve marine life which interests me in a marine biology degree. I have always been fascinated by marine life because I spent a lot of my time on boats and around the sea so it has made me passionate about the subject so it is something I would love to study.I am currently studying Biology, Geography and Maths which all provide me with relative knowledge to the course I want to study. Biology provides me with the foundation I need to study this course because I have learnt about how climate change can affect living animals and the problems caused and what can be done to reduce the problems which is a key aspect of the course. Biology has also allowed me to learn about the ecology of animals and how they can survive in a specific environment. I have also been on a residential trip to Wales where we studied the coastal areas and the wildlife around them which required me to use key skills which improved my research skills and will benefit me in the course. Geography has allowed me to study the environment and climate change and how humans affect it like global warming which is causing a rise in the sea temperature which causes coral bleaching affecting the habitat where a lot of marine life lives it also allows me to learn about coastal habitats and there importance to marine life and ways to prevent increasing problems caused by humans. Maths has given me vital skills for analysing and collecting statistical data which is very important to show changes in data so that comparisons can be made so we know how to prevent further effects of change to preserve the habitats.I completed my work experience at a company called Zenith Hygiene where I took part in day to day laboratory analysis of samples received from an in house laboratory. These included total viable counts, selective coliforms, lactic acid bacteria and clostridium spp. All the work I completed there was microbiology based, I tested these samples which gave me an insight into the testing required for different samples which I feel was very useful and helped me to gain a more scientific mind-set that I could apply to different testing and research that might be required in the course.In my spare time I attended Air Cadets which taught me how to work as a team and helped build my confidence and leadership skills. I also played football for Lymm piranhas for 7 years which helped me work well in a team, also I captained the team for the last 2 years which helped me to increase my leadership skills.In the future I wish to work in an active environment where I can put the skills I learned to use in fieldwork or research.\"])))\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"a262mvCoN2Sm","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1662050260978,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Simidola

I think it is important because marine biologists study the environment and ocean and how to make sustainable ways so that human beings can utilize resources from the ocean to improve the wellbeing of humans because the ocean provides one sixth of animal protein humans eat and living oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reducing the effects on climate change. With overfishing and the damage to the habitats I believe it is incredibly important to protect and conserve marine life which interests me in a marine biology degree. I have always been fascinated by marine life because I spent a lot of my time on boats and around the sea so it has made me passionate about the subject so it is something I would love to study.I am currently studying Biology, Geography and Maths which all provide me with relative knowledge to the course I want to study. Biology provides me with the foundation I need to study this course because I have learnt about how climate change can affect living animals and the problems caused and what can be done to reduce the problems which is a key aspect of the course. Biology has also allowed me to learn about the ecology of animals and how they can survive in a specific environment. I have also been on a residential trip to Wales where we studied the coastal areas and the wildlife around them which required me to use key skills which improved my research skills and will benefit me in the course. Geography has allowed me to study the environment and climate change and how humans affect it like global warming which is causing a rise in the sea temperature which causes coral bleaching affecting the habitat where a lot of marine life lives it also allows me to learn about coastal habitats and there importance to marine life and ways to prevent increasing problems caused by humans. Maths has given me vital skills for analysing and collecting statistical data which is very important to show changes in data so that comparisons can be made so we know how to prevent further effects of change to preserve the habitats.I completed my work experience at a company called Zenith Hygiene where I took part in day to day laboratory analysis of samples received from an in house laboratory. These included total viable counts, selective coliforms, lactic acid bacteria and clostridium spp. All the work I completed there was microbiology based, I tested these samples which gave me an insight into the testing required for different samples which I feel was very useful and helped me to gain a more scientific mind-set that I could apply to different testing and research that might be required in the course.In my spare time I attended Air Cadets which taught me how to work as a team and helped build my confidence and leadership skills. I also played football for Lymm piranhas for 7 years which helped me work well in a team, also I captained the team for the last 2 years which helped me to increase my leadership skills.In the future I wish to work in an active environment where I can put the skills I learned to use in fieldwork or research\",\n","         \"Psychology became a passion of mine when I started to learn about my mum's OCD.
